<br><b>Not Found says </b>'Oh. hello there. . I am Jhaya Wyndrunner; seamstress. druidic apprentice of The Rainkeeper. and native of the Jaggedpine Forest. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. but I really must be returning to my duties. Being away from the forest is so. . . troubling and I have a tendancy to become distracted when so far away from my home. But if you are member of the Jaggedpine alliance from Qeynos and The Rainkeeper guides your heart. then please. do return to me when you have gained a warm acceptance from your brethren in the Jaggedpine forest.''
