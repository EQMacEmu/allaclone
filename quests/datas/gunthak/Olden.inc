I've got a nasty cough and I don't want to be spreading it around.  Hopefully you haven't come to sell a green drogmor back, I'm afraid I might be allergic to them and that will make my cough even worse!  Oh, but I suppose I'll have to buy it back from you if you're sure you don't want it.  Show me your green drum and I'll make you a platinum offer for it.</font>
