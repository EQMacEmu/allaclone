<br><font color=green><b>Gaudric Stormwynd </b>motions for silence. 'Can you hear it?  The sound of nature crying out in pain. The children of Karana long for a release from this place of torment.' Gaudric turns away and appears to begin meditating.</font>
<p><b>You say, </b>'winds'
<br><b>Gaudric Stormwynd says </b>'The fury of a truly torrential storm is a beautiful thing. Even in their destruction they bring the birth of new life. Such is the cycle of life on Norrath, from the ashes nature always rebuilds. The trolls care nothing for this cycle though, and merely use the power of the storm to fill their treasuries. I hear the tormented cries of tempest [spirits] across the wind.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'spirits'
<br><b>Gaudric Stormwynd says </b>'I believe the followers of Nadox have found a way to control the spirits of the tempest by capturing them in amulets made of the black rock from the island. Bring me one of their amulets and I may be able to free the spirit from it.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'insect'
<br><b>Gaudric Stormwynd says </b>'A strange group of ant like creatures that I've named Nifiliks seems to be native to the island. I've never encountered creatures quite like this. They seem to have a sort of Hive consciousness. They have a vast range in size. The smallest are barely an inch or two across, while the largest can be upwards of four feet tall. The larger ones seem to be able to control the smaller ones by some sort of audible communication. I've heard the strange noises they make, but have yet to [mimic] them.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'mimic'
<br><b>Gaudric Stormwynd says </b>'The smallest ones do not seem to have as developed of a nervous system as the larger ones. They only act on the instincts and the commands of their masters. If we're able to mimic the sounds that they make, we may be able to control the smaller ones. If you're able to capture one of them alive and allow me to listen to its sounds I may be able to mimic them. You'll also need to bring me one of the smaller ones so I can observe its reactions.'
<p><b>You give Gaudric Stormwynd : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59038>A captured Nifilik</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59039>A tiny Nifilik</a>
<br><font color=green><b>Gaudric Stormwynd </b>takes the small nifilik and places it on the ground at his feet. He then partially unties the larger one causing it to let out some sort of high-pitched wailing. The small niflik on the table immediately begins to run across the ground toward you. You try to jump away but the nifilik still manages to latch onto your boot and crawl up under your armor. You howl in pain as the tiny creature bites repeatedly at your skin. Gaudric rebinds the larger nifilik and it stops wailing. The tiny creature below your armor stops biting at your skin.</font>
<br><font color=green><b>Gaudric Stormwynd </b>begins to scrawl several runes on a parchment and then hands it to you. 'I believe I've worked it out now. Unfortunately, our voices won't be able to make the sounds necessary to control these creatures, but with the help of Karana's magic you'll be able to imitate the sounds enough to control the small creatures. Use their power wisely, Ninlawen. As you know their bite is quite painful.</font>
<br><b>Gaudric Stormwynd gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59007>Spell: Swarm of Pain</a>
<br><font color=yellow>You gain experience!!</font>
<p><b>You give Gaudric Stormwynd : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59040>A glowing zraxthril amulet</a>
<br><font color=green><b>Gaudric Stormwynd </b>takes the amulet from your hands and holds it in front of his eyes. He begins to speak arcane words into the stone, holding his other hand under the amulet. The amulet begins to spasm around crazily on its cord as if some creature was trying to escape from it. Sweat begins to bead up at Gaudric's brow. Suddenly the amulet explodes with light and Gadric is thrown to the ground. You reach down and carefully pick the amulet from the ground. You notice a large crack across the face. A watery visage begins to rise from the crack and take shape before you. The tempest spriti coalesces into a vaguely humanoid form and motions toward you. He points directly to the amulet in your hands.</font>
<br><b>Gaudric Stormwynd gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59041>A cracked Zraxthril amulet</a>
