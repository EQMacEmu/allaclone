If you are a Necromancer you will need to gather halfling hides that have been infused with many different elements that you will collect and combine in this box. Simply tell me what pattern you want and I will present you with the recipe necessary for [Gloves]. [Robe]. [Trousers]. [Sleeves]. [Skullcap]. [Bracers] and [slippers]. I  would recommend you fashion your Robe last due to the difficulty and complex nature that is involved with finding the items necessary.'

I have kept the binding of this sacred tome for a very long time however I have never searched for the pages that form the writ. If you are able to recover the 4 pages of the writ I have faith that you posses the power to bind them to this empty tome that I carry. Seek out these pages and bind them to this tome. I assure you that you will learn much from this writ shall you construct it once again. I believe the pages were in the hands of spirits that haunt the Ultricle still to this day. Good luck and excellent work.'
