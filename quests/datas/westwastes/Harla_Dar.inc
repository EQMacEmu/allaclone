<br><b>Harla Dar says </b>'I do not have time for you now, Gaulven. My son is lost, and you can not help me.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'son'
<br><b>Harla Dar says </b>'Have you seen him? I must find him, he has been gone far to long! If you have harmed him, I will slay you and all of your
race! Tell me where he is!'

<br><b>Harla Dar says </b>'This...this is not what I had hoped for. My whelp is lost, but I take some comfort in knowing that you helped destroy his killer. Zlandicar has been a blight upon our race since the beginning. Here is your reward, as I promised. It will protect you in more ways than are obvious. Leave me now, it is time to mourn.'
