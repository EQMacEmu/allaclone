<br><b>Merchant Ayyad says </b>'Some of my wares are spoiling and I must place them in a container to preserve them. I cannot afford to take the loss that would result if they were to rot. Please [Your Name]. take this bowl and combine two lumps of gray mud with a flask of water and xakra bile. Take the resulting clay and this sketch with another water flask to fashion an unfired gray jar. Fire it in a kiln with a firing sheet and return to me with the product as soon as you can.'
