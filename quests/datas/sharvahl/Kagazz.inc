<br><b>Kagazz says </b>'My wife is making some jewelry. Not the sparkly stuff. mind you. She is nearly blind so appearance means little to her. She is intent on making jewelry with a more. uhh. natural feel. Currently she's constructing a special scorpion leg necklace. and is in need of more scorpion legs. I can't leave the shop so I need your help. Fill this box with scorpion legs and I'll pay you with metal fasteners that any merchant will gladly buy.'
