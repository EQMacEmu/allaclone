We need to outfit you with the equipment that defines our chosen path. Well start with your battleclaws... But be aware of the fact that it will take you some time before can use both sets in combat.  Just keep them both with you while you learn.'
<br><b>Animist Poren says </b>'Take this stitching pack and combine two shade silks from the xakra worms. Combine two of the resulting threads to make a bandage. Take this pattern and sew together three of the bandages. With considerable practice this will produce the handwraps that will be a foundation for your first sacred weapon. When you have created them return to me the scrap material.'
