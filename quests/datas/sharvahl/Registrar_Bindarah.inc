<br><b>Registrar Bindarah says </b>'Young [Your Name], I will be happy to process your registration for you. While I etch your name on our people's book of records I will require you to run a couple of errands. Take this certificate to the tax collector and obtain his seal. While you're out doing that, have Mignah create your personal Acrylia slate for you. Bring both the seal and the slate to me as soon as you can.'
