<br><b>Gravelady Beddia says </b>'Hail seeker of knowledge. There is much to be learned here in New Tanaan of the dark gods of Norrath. I have been searching the great library for tomes pertaining to my patron Bertoxxulous. the Plague Lord and made some interesting finds. If you wish to study the tomes I have uncovered you may borrow them and they will be returned to me by the magic of New Tanaan when you are through.'
