<br><b>Ethoach Trokith says </b>'Good day, [Your Name]. It would appear you have learned much about the art of stealth already, and this is good. Are you ready to learn more? If so, listen closely. To graduate to the next level of precision and cunning you need to discover a few items. Bring forth a Blizzard Gem, a Symbol of the Diaku, a Blue Diamond, and your Intermediate Stealth Manual. I feel this will be an adequate test of your skill at this stage in your development. Good luck!'
<p><b>You give Ethoach Trokith : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=22503>Blue Diamond</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=9423>Blizzard Gem</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=26709>Symbol of the Diaku</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28793>Intermediate Stealth Manual</a>
<br><b>Ethoach Trokith says </b>'I must say, this is a surprise. I was beginning to wonder if you would ever return with these. I'm glad you see you have though. Take this new book and use it well in your future journeys. You may also be interested to know that Tenada Jeried also has a few lesson plans for very advanced students. If you should see him, be sure to tell him you are interested in learning from him. Good luck to you, [Your Name]!'
<br><b>Ethoach Trokith gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28794>Advanced Stealth Manual</a>
<br><b>Ethoach Trokith says </b>'I don't need this.'
<p><i>This npc will return you any extra items you gave him.</i>
