<br><font color=green><b>Malcolm Thimbleton </b>reeks of elven wine and dwarven ale as you approach him. He's having a hard time putting a sentence together. "Salut. . . sassaf. . .swee. . .erm. . .hello [Your Name]! *hic* I'm sure you're here to. . .to. . .What was I saying? *hic* oh yes! you're here to turn your silly robe into a proper tunic! And I'm just the gnome to do it! Now where'd I put my needle and thread. *hic* Give me that silly robe and I'll make a proper piece of clothing out of it.'</font>

<br><font color=green><b>Malcolm Thimbleton </b>takes the tunic from you and peers at it. "What'd you give me this for [Your Name]? It's clearly not my size! Oh! you wanted it modified that's right." He turns and puts the robe on his work bench and slowly but surely goes to work on it. Half way through he spills some of his wine on it. Undaunted, he continues to work until he finally turns back to you and hands you a very well made tunic. Although it does smell of elven wine now.</font>
