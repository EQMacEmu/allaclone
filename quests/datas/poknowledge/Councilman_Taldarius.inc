<br><b>Councilman Taldarius says </b>'regards you, and grins. 'Greetings, [Your Name]. I am Councilman Taldarius, mighty Paladin of Mithaniel Marr and Guardian of the City of Tanaan! If you cannot find what you are looking for here in the Myrist library, I most certainly can add it to my list of things to look for in the Planes. Unfortunately, I am quite busy at the moment, planning my next trip to the Elemental Planes. I believe my aid may have some tasks he could use help with. That is, if you are skilled enough.''
<p><b>You say, </b>'marked runed signet'
<br><b>Councilman Taldarius says </b>'I see you have helped Grimel immensely. He would not have given up his signet very easily. I cannot let him deprive himself of such a valuable tool. If you were to do a task for me I would grant you something I picked up in the Planes. Are you interested in the task?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'interested in the task'
<br><b>Councilman Taldarius says </b>'Very well [Your Name]. I warn you I will not grant this without proof that you possess a valiant spirit. You may have the trust of my aid but I still require a noble deed. Through research done by the council they have discovered something called a Hope Stone that exists in the Elemental Planes. Bring me one of these stones and the signet of Grimel. Fear not I shall reward you well.'

<br><b>Councilman Taldarius says </b>'Wonderful! You have proven yourself as both a Master of the Trade as well as a valiant spirit. Take this and may it server you well! If this signet does not suffice, bring it back to me and i will exchange it for one more attuned to your needs.'
