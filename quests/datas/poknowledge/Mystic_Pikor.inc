<p><b>You say, </b>'Hail'
<br><b>Mystic Pikor says </b>'The mystics of New Tanaan greet [Your Name] openly. Do not be afraid of Pikor. for my appearance betrays my nature in this place. All are Pikor's equals. and none below me. I am a mystic of Innoruuk. but my faith in the dark father is not of blood and death any longer. Pikor is of knowledge and power beyond Norrath. and I must cast down my guidance of the eye and turn to the spirit. as shall you when your time comes. If you are a shaman. Pikor may guide you as I have scribed my memory of spells no longer useful here for shaman who seek and need the power.'
