<br><b>Wisdomseeker Raulin says </b>'Hail adventurous traveler! I have been researching the druidic heritages of various Norrathian cultures and have made some interesting finds here in the great library.  Feel free to borrow the books I have found if you like. The sorcery of the library will return the books to their proper places when you are through with them.'
