<br><b>Sten Harnak says </b>'Greetings to you [Your Name]. I am Sten Harnak Virtuoso of Freeport. I have lived in Freeport and studied the art of songweaving here for all of my days. I am always eager to see new faces here in our concert hall. If you are here for a performance I am afraid it does not start till a bit later but if you are a young bard in training then I might have some [work] for you.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what work'
<br><b>Sten Harnak says </b>'Well I have numerous concerts here that I must prepare for so I always must be sure that I have the best possible support as far as my fellow bards go. I am always seeking new young talent to sing in our concerts. If you are a bard I have made tasks for you to complete to see if you are a worthy songweaver. These tasks will test your determination and battle skills. I would only allow one that has completed all of my [specific tests] to sing in my concert hall.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what specific tests'
<br><b>Sten Harnak says </b>'If you are ready to begin your training I will assign you a number of tests. These tests will enable you to outfit yourself with a suit of armor only worn by the most respected musicians of Freeport. First. I will present you with a Songweavers Assembly Kit. In this kit you will combine certain [recipes] that will be magically formed into an armor material. Each one of these materials will need to be combined in a forge with the appropriate mold to make your armor piece.'

<br><b>Sten Harnak says </b>'I have the material recipes available for Songweavers Platemail [Helms]. [Bracers]. [Armguards]. [Boots]. [Greaves]. [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to craft a specific piece simply tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft. For example if you would wish to craft a helm tell me “I want to craft a helm”. Also please keep in mind that the components necessary for crafting your breastplate material are the most difficult to collect so you might want to collect them last.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'i want to craft armguards'
<br><b>Sten Harnak says </b>'Armguards will keep your arms well protected in battle from any foe you may face. To create your armguard material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Preserved Snake Eye, 1 Burned Out Lightstone and 1 Mead in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Songweavers Platemail Armguards.'

<p><b>You say, </b>'what important task'
<br><b>Sten Harnak says </b>'There has been numerous reports lately of the Orcs in the Commonlands being up to no good. Some actually believe that they are stockpiling wood for some odd reason.  Regardless of their purpose the increased number of orcs in any given area just spells trouble for all the surrounding areas. I need you to go and [collect some warbeads] from some high ranking orcs. Obtaining these warbeads will not be easy I would presume. Will you assist me in this final task?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'i will collect some warbeads'
<br><b>Sten Harnak says </b>'I am very pleased to hear that you will be able to help us. The warbeads that I require will be found on specific Orc Chieftans. I am sure they are not alone and are well guarded so make sure you bring companions with you that are well proven on the battlefield. Bring me the warbeads of Chief Fosloas, Diedridan and Kelleru. I look forward to seeing you soon.'
