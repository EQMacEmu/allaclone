<br><b>Groflah Steadirt says </b>'Where did you find this? This was the main price list of Zimel's Blades, but it should be all burnt up. I was at Zimel's right after the fire and I did not see it hanging where it should have been. The entire inside was gutted and . . . wait . . . the sequence of the dots!! Hmmm. I cannot talk with you here. Meet me at the Seafarer's by the docks at night. Give me the note when next we meet.'
