<br><b>Akksstaff says </b>'What do you want?! Foolish , I am in no mood to treat with beggars. I have half a mind to turn my pet here loose on you! Well, don't keep me waiting, state your business or be off with you!'
<p><b>You say, </b>'tell me about magi'kot'
<br><b>Akksstaff says </b>'Ah, that I can help you with. Magi'kot was a powerful elementalist, able to control the power of the elements which surrounded him. He was not able to fully master the elements when I was learning from him, but soon after my departure I heard rumors that he was going after the Orb of Mastery. At the time, I did not feel he was ready to harness all the elements, but Magi'kot listened to no one. He was in search of power beyond any held by a mortal. Do you wish to hear more?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'wish to hear more'
<br><b>Akksstaff says </b>'Then bring me the torn pages of Mastery, there are four pages that can be found upon the women In this keep, though have a care, Najena's followers guard her treasures carefully, and delight in punishing trespassers.'

<br><b>Akksstaff says </b>'Very well. Take these words back to that shriveled old gnome, Rykas, if you wish to complete this quest. Now leave me, [Your Name], it sickens me to be this cordial for so long. And my pet needs exercise. Go!'
<br><b>Akksstaff gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28004>Words of Mastery</a>
<br><b>Akksstaff says </b>'I do not need these.'
