To craft your Cap of the White Rose, you will need two Spiderling Silks, two Bone Chips, and one Gnoll Pup Scalp. You should be able to find these items by hunting in Everfrost. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the White Rose Cap Material to a loom along with this pattern to create your new cap.'
