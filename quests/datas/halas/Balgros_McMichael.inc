You will use it to create the various parts of your armor such as [helm], [bracers], [armplates], [boots], [legplates], [gauntlets], and [breastplate]. When you combine components in your kit, make sure they are un-stacked. Let me know what piece you wish to craft and I will give you instruction.'

To craft your Helm of Justice, you will need two Small Pieces of Ore, one Gnoll Pup Scalp, and two Bone Chips. You should be able to find most of these items in Everfrost. The ore is most likely sold here in town. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Helm of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new helm.'
