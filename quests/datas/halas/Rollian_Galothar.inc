<br><b>Rollian Galothar says </b>'I will give you instructions to make your first set of armor. Just keep in mind that I don't tolerate those that are lazy! Once you start something, you should always finish it! With that said, take this Northern Wolf Plate Assembly Kit. You will use it to create the various parts of your armor such as [helm], [bracers], [armplates], [boots], [legplates], [gauntlets], and [breastplate]. When you combine components in your kit, make sure they are un-stacked. Let me know what piece you wish to craft and I will give you instructions.'

Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Helm of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new helm.'
