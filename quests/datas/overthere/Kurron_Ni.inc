<br><b>Kurron Ni says </b>'Out of my way, stranger!  I am on a delicate mission; interfere with my search and I shall relieve you of your head! Bother me no more.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'mission'
<br><b>Kurron Ni says </b>'My mission was to find a pathetic shadowknight and bring him closer to Innoruuk. You volunteered. By exercising my superior powers of persuasion, I have now taken from you a fine suit of armor and enough coin to ensure that I will be sleeping neither soberly nor alone for quite some time! Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight, do you not feel the fires of hatred coursing through your veins like never before? That is the very reward I spoke of! You have been brought closer to my master. My mission is complete! You foolish excuse for a dark knight, I shall take your head and tell all of your generous donation to the mighty Teir'Dal rogues!'
<p><b>You say, </b>'seek'
<br><b>Kurron Ni says </b>'I have traveled here in hopes of finding a soul worthy of assisting me in completing my mission.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'i am worthy'
<br><b>Kurron Ni says </b>'I doubt it, but I have been wrong before. Before I share with you the details of my mission, however, you must first prove your worthiness. Agreed?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'agreed'
<br><b>Kurron Ni says </b>'Very well then, my new friend. I have an acquaintance that stands in need of three pieces of Darkforge Armor. He requires the breast, greaves and helm to complete his set. I also must pay back a loan that has come due in the amount of 900 platinum. Return this to me and I shall share with you my dark mission, and the immeasurable reward that will be earned at its completion. Show your face here without fulfilling my request and I will offer you on the altar to Innoruuk himself. Be off!'
<p><b>You give Kurron Ni : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=3145>Darkforge Greaves</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=3141>Darkforge Breastplate</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=3140>Darkforge Helm</a>
<br><b>Kurron Ni says </b>'Well done, [Your Name], I honestly didn't expect to see you again. Yes, yes, this is perfect! My mission is nearly complete!'
