<br><b>Taldrik Stumpystout says </b>'Move along dere yer blocking me view lad. I await me friend that has gone off to fetch me some water. I sure is hot out here.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'recipe'
<br><b>Taldrik Stumpystout says </b>'Well ya see lad I had an ancient recipe passed down to me that told one how to create the holiest of ale. Its far gone now, however I recently had a vision of the ingredients and where they might be found. Do you wish to seek out the [components] for me?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'components'
<br><b>Taldrik Stumpystout says </b>'Excellent lad! Let meh see here if I can remembur correctly. I know that you need Preserved hops and a Battleworn cantine. I know that these were carried by my good friend Torklar back when I was still a young lad training like you. However one day he adventured to an undead estate with a friend of his that was a skilled brewer. I believe they went there in search of some ingredients they needed for a recipe however neither of them ever returned. But before you go any further I must tell ye that you will need a specific kind of [cask] to combine these items in.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'cask'
<br><b>Taldrik Stumpystout says </b>'Why a holy cask is what ye will need of course! Find the ingredients that I asked you for before and combine them within this holy cask along with barley from the forests of Kithicor and water summoned from none other then yourself. After doing this if the gods have smiled upon you a thick and hearty keg of Brells Blessed Stout will be created. Give this to me along with a Rat sandwich to enjoy while I sip the finest of ales as well as your initiate symbol that you carry now and I will be sure to reward you.'
