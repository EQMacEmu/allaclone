<p><b>You say, </b>'what current research'
<br><b>Sejako Mujan says </b>'Recently patrols have been sent to the Stonebrunt Mountains to investigate rumors of an alliance between the Kejekans and Erudin. There is much spiritual activity in that region of Odus and the patrols have reported encountering massive beasts called Titans. These titans exhibit abilities that lead me to believe they are powerful animal spirits that have somehow taken on a physical form in order to enter and manipulate the realm of the living. I require [samples] of the Titans physiology in order to further my research.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what samples'
<br><b>Sejako Mujan says </b>'There have been sightings of Titans in many forms. The samples I require are the fangs of the leopard. sabretooth. and gorilla titans. and the rattle of the snake titan.'
