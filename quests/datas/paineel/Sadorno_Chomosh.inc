<br><b>Sadorno Chomosh says </b>'Salutations. I am Sadorno Chomosh, Templar of Terror. The path of terror taught to us by Cazic-Thule is a dangerous way of life. The perils are great, but the rewards are unimaginable power. In order to harness the powers of fear, you must first know that which you seek to control: terror, dread and fright. I presume that you are still young and have much to learn. If that is the case, I will assist you in acquiring [armaments] to aid you on your journey to power.'

Do you desire to craft a templar of fright [helm], a templar of fright [bracer], templar of fright [gauntlets], templar of fright [boots], templar of fright [vambraces], templar of fright [greaves], or a templar of fright [breastplate]?'

The priests of Prexus and Quellious in the city of Erudin seek to purge Odus of our kind, for they view us as a disgrace to the Erudite race. Behind their disdain, however, lies fear. It is this fear that allows us to prosper and become more powerful than the closed-minded fools of Erudin. In the Toxxulia Forest, you will find such a fool, a priest named Terago Omath. This priest attempts to ward the Toxxulia Forest from the presence of the undead.  Seek this Terago Omath and return to me with his head.'
