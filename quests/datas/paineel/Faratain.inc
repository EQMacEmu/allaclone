<p><b>You say, </b>'what task'
<br><b>Faratain says </b>'The blacksmiths of [Clan Kolbok] craft weapons using an ancient Kobold tradition that has been long forgotten by most of the kobold clans. I believe there is something to be learned from their traditions should we discover their intricacies. Go into the Warrens and locate the chambers of the kobold blacksmiths. There you should be able to find some record of their traditional techniques to return to me here in Paineel where they can be translated and studied.'
