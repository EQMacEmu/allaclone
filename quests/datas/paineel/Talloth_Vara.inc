<br><b>Talloth Vara says </b>'Greetings. [Your Name].  You have come to the Anthenaeum Necromanita.  This place serves as the stores of knowledge for the Seekers of the [Dark Truth].'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what dark truth'
<br><b>Talloth Vara says </b>'The Dark Truth is what all the [necromancers] in Paineel seek to learn.  The [real truth] is far more interesting.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what necromancers'
<br><b>Talloth Vara says </b>'The necromancers here are called the Seekers of the Dark Truth.  The leader of the Seekers is known as the Speaker of the Dark Truth.  The current Speaker is Coriante Verisue.  She does. however. have many [rivals].'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what rivals'
<br><b>Talloth Vara says </b>'I support Coriante due to my respect for her.  Many have no such respect and covet her power and position.  One such individual is Darton. the Seeker's Chief Researcher.  He is a direct descendant of [Dartain]. a hero to our people.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'who is dartain'
<br><b>Talloth Vara says </b>'That is a long story indeed. [Your Name].  Many years ago. the heretics and the people of Erudin had a grand battle.  During the conflicts. great magics were performed and many catastrophic effects plagued these lands. a good example of which would be the Hole.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what real truth'
<br><b>Talloth Vara says </b>'The real truth is actually a theory of mine which I believe to be true.  You see. the Seekers believe that necromancy is all that can be gained from the Dark Truth. whereas I believe it is merely a by-product.'
