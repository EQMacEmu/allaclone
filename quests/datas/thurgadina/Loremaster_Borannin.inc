<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'Greetings, [Your Name], please be seated and hear the Grand Historian, he is among the wisest of our people.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'duties for the crown'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'Those eager to prove their loyalty to the Dain may do so by completing tasks that I have been commissioned to assign. If you wish to begin your service, return to me with four toes of our enemy, the Kromrif.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'task'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'Every year the Dain replaces the trophies in his trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy obtained. I intend to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer shawl for assisting me. Fill this box with ten Kromrif heads and bring me the combined contents along with the burlap shawl. I will submit the best one for the Dain's consideration.'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=17102>Preservationists Box</a>
<p><b>You say, </b>'chore'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordin. He will instruct you further.'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=1420>Borannin's Seal</a>
<p><b>You say, </b>'brewing'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'Ahh yes, good to see you again, [Your Name]. I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'accept this mission'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance. Scour the regions surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect you.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'advance my reputation'
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'[Your Name]! Thank Brell you're here. I was about to send one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik acquired is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of the council and I must attend. We don't have the luxury of waiting for an appropriate task to arise, you must advance as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next few shawls for you. Ask Rexx Frostweaver about the prayer shawl and follow his direction carefully.'
<p><b>You give Loremaster Borannin : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=29125>Frost Giant Toes</a> x4
<br><b>Loremaster Borannin says </b>'Ahh, well done! On behalf of the Dain I thank you for making a dent in the number of our sworn enemy. Please accept this as a token of our appreciation. It is trivial, I know, but if you are as loyal as you claim to be, it will increase in power over time. It just so happens I have a [task] to further demonstrate your loyalty, [Your Name].'
