<br><b>Groo McManus says </b>'Greetings adventure seeker. I have come from afar to study this strange thicket. The spirits are strong within this region, but they are secretive as well.  I am willing to impart my wisdom to those who will aid me in my exploration. Are you [interested?]'
<p><b>You say, </b>'I am interested'
<br><b>Groo McManus says </b>'Very well then! Let us begin.  First you must attune yourself with the nature of spirits. For this you must learn to find a spiritual anchor. Find such a thing within the crater that surrounds Shar Vahl and return it to me.  Then we may continue. I cannot tell you more, but there is a Vah Shir who has the knowledge that you seek. Seek him out in this thicket to learn what you can.'
