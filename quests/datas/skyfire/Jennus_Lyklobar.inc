<br><b>Jennus Lyklobar says </b>'Hello and well met! A  like you does not often come here.. Do you come seeking what I possess? Fire, fire, fire and fire is mine! I surround myself with fire, I bathe in fire, I consume fire, I am the Master of Fire! Hahahaha, but I digress. Have you come for the element of Fire, seeking to fall to the same fate as Trilith Magi'kot?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'i have come for the element of fire'
<br><b>Jennus Lyklobar says </b>'The Element of Fire I can provide you, but you must prove you are able to contain its power. Bring me the Torch of the Elements now kept by a doomed lord of merchants, the burning embers from a notable member of wurmkind who can be found a short journey from here and a blazing wand, which you should be familiar with. And you must surrender the tome Rykas gave you. But I think you would be happier if you stayed with me and learned more of the beauty of the one true element, FIRE! FIRE! Hahahahahahah!'
<p><b>You give Jennus Lyklobar : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=18958>Power of the Orb</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28007>Torch of the Elements</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=10376>Blazing Wand</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28008>Burning Embers</a>
<br><b>Jennus Lyklobar says </b>'I see that you are well versed in the ways of Fire. Indeed, if you are as adept in the other, lesser elements, you may just seize the Orb of Mastery after all, and avoid Magi'kot's fate. Take this element, and guard it well, for more trials are to come, I assure you. Succeed and you shall be remembered always! Oh, and [Your Name]? Watch out for the puddles! HAHAHAHAHAHA!'
<br><b>Jennus Lyklobar gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28009>Element of Fire</a>
<br><font color=yellow>You gain experience!!</font>
<br><b>Jennus Lyklobar says </b>'I do not need these.'
