<br><b>Shmendrik Lavawalker says </b>'Hail, good [Your Name]!! Be wary near the waters of Lake Rathe! The Riptide goblin king, Lord Bergurgle, has been commanding his minions to murder and rob all who come near it! I am here seeking his death but I am afraid I am no match for all of his subjects. I shall reward you greatly for the death of Lord Bergurgle. I simply ask that you bring me his crown as proof.'
<hr><b>When Shmendrik Lavawalker is killed </b>
<p><b>You give Shmendrik Lavawalker : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28044>Lord Bergurgle's Crown</a>
<br><font color=green><b>Shmendrik Lavawalker </b>shoves the crown into a scorch marked leather satchel and cackles uncontrollably as madness twists his features and flames dance in his eyes. 'You, [Your Name], have reduced the Riptides into chaos! Without a king to keep them in control they will ravage the settlements surrounding this lake! After the slaughter I shall return and easily burn the remainder of the villages and fishing shanties to the ground! None shall escape the fires of the Tyrant!!'</font>
