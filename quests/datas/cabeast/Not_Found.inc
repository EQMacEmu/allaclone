<br><b>Not Found says </b>'Hail. citizen. I hope that you are here to assist.  We are gathering Crusaders to make an assault on the Libraries of Chardok.  The slave creations have thrived in their sanctuary for too long.  The tomes and texts they have stolen to fill their library belong us.  They are even rumored to have a text on the Sacred Khukri of Rile. the Greenmist.  If you see such a tome. you must bring it to me immediately.  May Cazic-Thule guide you!'
