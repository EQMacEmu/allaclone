<p><b>You say, </b>'serve Innoruuk'
<br><b>Raltur Caliskon says </b>'Wise choice. We of the Dismal Rage have learned of the value of incompetence. As the Teir'Dal use the ogres and the trolls so to shall the Dismal Rage have A pawn in this game. Ours is the Freeport Militia. They trust us. How unfortunate for them. I want you to go speak with Sir Lucan D'lere, the so called ruler of this city and leader of this mob of ruffians called the Freeport Militia. Tell him you are [ from the Shrine of Innoruuk ]. Do as he asks. Little favors lead to large debts. And if you should find something of importance, bring it to me not that inept warrior.'
