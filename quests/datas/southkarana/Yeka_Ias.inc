<br><font color=green><b>Yeka Ias </b>grabs the heart as you toss it to him before realizing what it is. As soon as it touches his hands, his body convulses, a sickly light emanating from his eyes and oozing cracks appear in his skin. As he melts into the ground, a small glowing ball floats where he once stood.</font>
<br><b>Yeka Ias disappears.</b>
