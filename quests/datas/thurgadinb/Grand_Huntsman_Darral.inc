<br><b>Grand Huntsman Darral says </b>'Hail and welcome to the Dain's trophy room. Not many people realize that aside from bein' a great warrior and king. Frostreaver is also one of our nation's greatest hunters. Here you can see some examples of his handiwork including orcs, a frost giant, a snow griffin, and even a rare albino manticore! You can find many such rare critters in the Eastern Wastes. Good luck and happy huntin'.'
