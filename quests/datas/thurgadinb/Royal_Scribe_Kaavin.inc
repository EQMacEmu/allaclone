<br><b>Royal Scribe Kaavin says </b>'Hello there, as the official Royal Scribe of Dain Frostreaver IV, it is my duty to pen, NO . . . WAIT. . . write. NO . . . I mean scribe, yes that's the word I'm looking for. I scribe the thoughts of the Dain for posterity. I currently have record books with a combined 11,982 pages of notes detailing the life and business of our present Dain. You see, I have a rather bad memory, so I write everything down. My latest entry is that on this day [Your Name] came and talked to me. Anyhow, I'm sure you have much better things to do than talk to me, so good luck in your ventures, [Your Name], and come visit me any time.'
