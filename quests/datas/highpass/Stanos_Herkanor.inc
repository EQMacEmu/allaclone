<br><b>Stanos Herkanor says </b>'Ah, the pouch. This is the first step. The Circle has to be upset having this taken right out from under them. That speaks well of the person who did the taking. Hanns must be even more furious now. I think I might be able to trust you. We could make a deal. I have a blade I won't use anymore, and you have those fine looking daggers Vilnius gave you. Of course, you would have to do something for me first. Let me tell you my story, then you decide.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'tell me your story'
<br><b>Stanos Herkanor says </b>'Johann Krieghor was the leader of the Circle and I was his second-in-command. He made a dark bargain with a Teir'Dal General. The Circle was to assassinate Joren, the high elf ambassador to Qeynos. Had the plot worked, it would have weakened the alliance between high elves and humans, and possibly caused a war between the two powers. In either case, the Teir'Dal would have profited greatly by this event, and all others would have suffered. I could not stand by and let this happen, but Johann would not be deterred, for the Teir'Dal had promised him much. I had no choice but to kill Johann and the Teir'Dal agent. I made it look like they offed each other, and then I hid the tools.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what tools'
<br><b>Stanos Herkanor says </b>'To allow the assassin to slay a prince, and fight his way back out, a fell blade was crafted. It was small enough to conceal under a garment and yet large enough to strike a mortal blow through armor. Aided by vile Teir'Dal enchantments, it is much more fearsome than it appears. I would gladly rid myself of it, but I fear I can not until I clear my name with Hanns.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'clear your name'
<br><b>Stanos Herkanor says </b>'I need proof that what I say about Johann is truth, so that Hanns may forgive me. YOU can gather that proof for me. First, travel to Kaladim and Neriak, and there, upon the persons of the rogue guildmasters, you should find that which I seek, two parts of a document I recovered from the dead agent. I entrusted one to Founy, but that trust is gone, and Founy would betray me to Hanns were I to attempt to reclaim it. Tani N'mar has the other, which he should not possess, and keeps it only to spite me, not knowing its real importance. Steal them both, and bring them back to me. And don't let anyone follow you! If I am not around, tell Anson you want to see me.'
