<p><b>You say, </b>'I am a smart ogre'
<br><b>Marda says </b>'Well. I suppose your intelligence shall grow. You will have to do. I have a mission for you. First. go and speak with Grevak of the Greenblood Knights. He will have a job for you. After you have performed some manner of service and advanced at least 5 ranks. return to me and ask me about my secret mission.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what secret mission'
<br><b>Marda says </b>'I have heard of your advancements. You are a fine addition to Oggok. I require your skill in handling a delicate matter. I want you to run out to the Bouncer's keep near the entrance to Oggok. There. you shall find a froglok named Glib. He will pose no threat to you. He has come on business and I have promised him protection. Tell him the Greenblood shaman sent you. He shall fill you in. Go at once.'
