<br><b>Kizrak the Tyrant says </b>'Yes? What do you want?! I have one [purpose] here, to speak with potential heroes that the gods send to me, not to make pointless chit chat with some base, frail mortal I could destroy in less time than it would take for me to unsheathe my weapon.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'purpose'
<br><b>Kizrak the Tyrant says </b>'Are you as deaf as you are ugly? I had stated before what my purpose here is, and I will not repeat myself. You apparently know nothing of [Kizrak the Tyrant], nor of my glorious victories and domination among the heroes.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'fools'
<br><b>Kizrak the Tyrant says </b>'The ogres, of course! I am not even sure if that is such a fitting name of these monstrous, fleshy bags of stupidity. Before the curse of Zek, the ogres were the strongest of the gods' creations upon Norrath. I am a product of our greatest years of glory, and it was then that I [ascended] to take my place within the Realm of Heroes. I am sure that my lack of third person speech had you a bit confused as to my origins.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'how ascended?'
<br><b>Kizrak the Tyrant says </b>'I led a mighty army for several decades serving the powers of war. My deeds were recognized by The Warlord himself, and in return for my strengthening of his name in battle, I was chosen to walk the Realm of Heroes. Now, I find that I have returned to a nation of slobbering buffoons who have allied with the Teir`Dal, of all creatures. It is almost painful to be subjected to the witnessing of it, but, as The [Warlord commands], it shall be done.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'Warlord'
<br><b>Kizrak the Tyrant says </b>'My purpose, fool! My purpose is The Warlord's command! I grow tired of you. Bring forth the coin, if of course any god would be so out of their right mind as to bestow such honor to a creature as filthy and devoid of intelligence as yourself, or leave me be before I find a much more painful route to deliver you to the hand of your god.'
