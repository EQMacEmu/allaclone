<p><b>You say, </b>'slumber'
<br><b>Askr the Lost says </b>'The Rainkeeper lies in deep meditation at the top of the great tower, Torden. His meditations have some how become tainted by a force from outside the plane. He lies in his tower besieged by all manner of dark visions and dreamscapes. I cannot fathom the focus it must take to discern the clairvoyance that the Rainkeeper controls. It is surely his fitful sleep that has caused this turmoil to reign here. You must [gain entrance] to Torden, [Your Name].'
<p><b>You say, </b>'gain entrance'
<br><b>Askr the Lost says </b>'An ethereal seal that is protected by the collective power of the lightning, blizards, tornadoes, and sandstorms guards the tower. You must collect the essence of these storms in order to create the key that will allow you to enter the tower of Torden. But first you must earn the right to enter the [courtyard] of the Bastion. From there you will be able to find the storm essences.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'courtyard'
<br><b>Askr the Lost says </b>'The courtyard will allow you access to the four greater towers as well as Torden itself. The strongest giants of the lower halls most likely hold the key that you will need to enter the courtyard. Be wary of the giants in this stronghold [Your Name], the each hold a piece of the great power of the Rainkeeper, unbridled by his control and wisdom.'
