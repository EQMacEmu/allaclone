When you are ready to craft a certain armor piece all you must do is tell me which piece you [want] to craft. I will then present you with the component recipe along with the applicable pattern for Craft Keeper [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. When you have completed the material for whatever piece you asked for you will combine it in a sewing kit with the appropriate pattern to fashion your armor piece. Its as easy as that. I suggest though that you attempt your robe last as the components are more difficult then any other piece to collect.'
