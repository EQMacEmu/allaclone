<br><b>Lozani says </b>'Greetings. friend!!  I am Lozani. Scribe Supreme of the Eldritch Collective.  I have been sent forth from the great Library of Mechanimagica in the city of Ak'Anon. to study the arcane knowledge of man and beast alike.  I have studied many languages and spells. from Crushbone to Kerra Ridge.  I have found most languages hard to decipher.  As of this date. I have learned to read only the script of the [orc oracles].  Oh well. I am on a five decade mission.  Better luck next language.'
