<br><b>Cedric Trallus says </b>''Hello [Your Name], chancing a journey to Brokenskull are you? Many have ventured there, but few have returned. I was favored by the will of Thule to return here in one piece, although I would not call my [journey] exactly successful.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'journey'
<br><b>Cedric Trallus says </b>'Our spies in Erudin were able to learn that a voyage of Deepwater knights was setting sail in search of Brokenskull Island. Our priests in Paineel had received several visions from the lord Cazic telling of great powers that might be found on this island. Our group was instructed to follow their ship across the waters and explore the island should we find it. Find it they did, and more then they ever bargained for on that [cursed isle].'
<p><b>You say, </b>'cursed isle'
<br><b>Cedric Trallus says </b>'Just as the Deepwater knights were about to drop anchor near a small cove on the island, we attacked them. The magic cloaks we had placed over our ship did their job all too well. We took them by surprise and our forces easily overpowered them, but our battle was joined by a [third force].'
<p><b>You say, </b>'third force'
<br><b>Cedric Trallus says </b>'A group of strange creatures crawled up the side of the boats and began to attack everyone on both sides. They cut through many of us before we were able to retreat our forces back to our ship and turn our sails away from the island. Several of the creatures pursued us through the water with amazing speed. We fought them off and we forced them back into the sea. We were able to slay one of them, or so we thought. We brought the [body] back to Paineel for the priests to study.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'body'
<br><b>Cedric Trallus says </b>'When we docked here in Paineel we were carrying the body off of the ship when suddenly the creature came to life. It threw several of our knights into the water and then jumped in himself and swam off into the ocean. We suspect that it used some form of magic to fool us into believing it was actually dead. The necromancers of Paineel are not easily fooled in matters of life and death. We greatly desire to study the [organs] of these creatures to learn the secret of this new magic.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'organs'
<br><b>Cedric Trallus says </b>'Bring me two samples of these creatures internal organs for our priests to study and we may share the secret of their magic with you. Something tells me you won't come back alive, though.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'robes'
<p><b>You give Cedric Trallus : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59035>Luggald Organs</a> (x2)

<br><font color=green><b>Cedric Trallus </b>takes the organs from you and lays them down on the ground before him. He begins to slice and separate the organs from one another with a wicked looking dagger. Dark blue blood stains his robe as he probes the strange flesh. Finally after several minutes he smiles and pulls a parchment from a bag at his side and begins to draw several runes using the dark blue blood.</font>
<br><b>Cedric Trallus says </b>'Take this, I have discovered the secret of their magic, or so I believe. Of course it might not work and you'll end up actually dead, but we'll never know till you try, will we?'
<br><b>Cedric Trallus gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59006>Spell: Blood of Pain</a>
<br><font color=green><b>Cedric Trallus </b>As you take the scroll from him you notice a sickly burning odor in the air. You glance down at Cedric's robes and notice several holes beginning to form where the blood touches his [robes].</font>
<br><font color=yellow>You gain experience!!</font>
<p><b>You give Cedric Trallus : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59051>Luggald saliva</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59050>Luggald bile</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=59036>Luggald Blood</a>
