I would love to talk but I have to teach a class very soon to the new [initiates] and I don't have my lesson prepared yet. Are you also a [young initiate of the Eldritch Collective]? If you are then I hope you will be ready for the lesson.'

In this sewing kit you will combine a number of recipes that will be used for creating your Eldritch Collective Initiate Armor. When you are ready to craft a certain armor piece all you must to is tell me which piece you [want] to craft. I will then present you with the component recipe along with the applicable pattern for [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. When you have completed the material for whatever piece you asked for you will combine it in a sewing kit with the appropriate pattern to fashion your armor piece. I do suggest though that you attempt your robe last as the components are more difficult then any other piece to collect.'

I had them bound in a special tome but unfortunately some pickpockets stole them from me in hopes that they would bring them great power I suppose. If you can find these 4 pages for me I would be very grateful for I would be able to finish my studies of them. Will you [seek out the stolen tome pages]?'

<br><b>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says </b>'I am very pleased to hear that you are willing to help and from your track record I have no doubt in my mind that you will be able to retrieve these pages. I would guess that they were given to the Dark Reflection casters for study after they were stolen from me so that would be where I would look. These casters do not understand our cause and serve dark gods so lethal force may be necessary. Just please be careful and make sure you have worthy adventuring partners with you because the battle may not be easy.'
