<br><b>Naygog Mitope says </b>'Hail [Your Name]. I train those young gnomes who wish to [serve as a warrior] in the service of the Dark Reflection and our patron. Bertoxxulous the Plaguelord. Decay and destruction are powerful forces that influence Norrath. It is the duty of the Warriors of the Dark Reflection to bring destruction to the weak and injury to the strong so that our fellow gnomes may be reminded of their own mortality and new strong individuals may rise to power before Bertoxxulous decides it is their time to decay and be replaced like countless before them.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'i serve as a warrior'
<br><b>Naygog Mitope says </b>'Ours is the duty of a martyr. to be the hated and feared hand of destruction and catalyst of change. All roads are paved with destruction and in turn are eventually destroyed. All machines are built from the rubble of broken mountains and in turn become rust and bits of metal. You must outfit yourself with the tools of a warrior. crafted from the destruction of archaic clockworks that have long since finished serving the purpose for which they were built. Take this parchment to Windlebeck Tobokog. he will assist you in the construction of a suit of armor. When you have been properly outfitted return to me for [further instruction].'
<br><b>Naygog Mitope gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=10986>Parchment to Windlebeck</a>
<p><b>You say, </b>'further instruction'
<br><b>Naygog Mitope says </b>'It is one thing to destroy the artificial life of a clockwork. It is another thing entirely to claim the life of another gnome. There is a member of the Dark Reflection. Yulcabis. who has been assigned to a task in the Steamfont Mountains. He has failed repeatedly in the tasks assigned to him in the past and has become a burden to the Dark Reflection. Find Yulcabis and slay him. Return to me with the weapon he carries.'
