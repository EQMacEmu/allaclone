<br><b>Lewis Reldnok says </b>'Greetings [Your Name]! I am Lewis Reldnok. first Paladin of the Deep Muses. When I was just a young lad I journeyed to Kaladim. the home of our cousins the Dwarves. At the Temple of the Duke of Below I studied the ways of a Paladin of our creator Brell Serilis. I have returned to Ak'Anon to train interested young gnomes the ways I have mastered so that we may defend Ak'Anon and Brells disciples everywhere from the threats that would see us destroyed. If you are a Paladin of the Deep Muses I have some [armor quests] for you to complete.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what armor quests?'
<br><b>Lewis Reldnok says </b>'I have armor quests that I present to young gnomish paladins when they are ready to venture out into the Mountains of Steamfont and begin their training. Are you a gnome that is [ready for training]?'
<p><b>You say, </b>'im ready for training'
<br><b>Lewis Reldnok says </b>'Fantastic! Let me first begin by telling you how you will create your armor young [Your Name]. I will present you with a Tinkerers Mail Assembly Kit that you will use to collect all different kinds of items from Ak'anon and from the Steamfont Mountaints. You will use specific [armor recipes] in this kit to create materials that you will use along with the molds I provide you with in a forge to create your armor!'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what armor recipes'
<br><b>Lewis Reldnok says </b>'I have all the armor recipes and molds that you will need to get started all you must do is simply tell me what armor piece you [want to craft]. I can provide you with the recipes and molds for Deep Muses [Helms]. [Bracers]. [Armguards]. [Boots]. [Greaves]. [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. I must recommend that you attempt to gather the items for your breastplate last because the components required for it are the most difficult to collect.'
