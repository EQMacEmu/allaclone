<br><b>Terren Starwatcher says </b>'If you are ready to put your life on the line for the citizens of our homeland than hear my words.

Our seers have divined the name of the orc that is in possession of the amulet. Gurleg Bribgok. Find this despicable creature and return the amulet to me so that I may return it to its proper owner.'
