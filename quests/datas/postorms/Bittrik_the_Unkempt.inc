Looking to unmask the secret of the Kingdom of Lok? I might indeed have that story tucked away somewhere. Perhaps you'd fancy a smaller story. one revolving around an ill-tempered giant? That one happens to be one of my favorites! Of course. there are the stories of raging Storms to be found through this land. which I know plenty about as well. So. what'll it be. friend?'
