<br><b>Furball Miller says </b>'Blackburrow is home to a clan of gnolls called the Sabertooths.  It is where I am from but I really don't ever remember being there.  Pa tells me the gnolls there are always fighting with the <BARK!>  humans of Qeynos.  I wish they would stop and realize that humans and gnolls are not as different as they like to think.  <BARK!>'
