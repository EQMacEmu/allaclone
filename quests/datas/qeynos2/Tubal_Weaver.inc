<br><b>Tubal Weaver says </b>'Hail. [Your Name]!  I am Tubal Weaver. humble merchant and retired guardsman of Highkeep.  I make a tidy living dealing with the throngs of adventurers who take it upon themselves to keep Qeynos beetle-free.  If you want some free advice. I recommend that you not deal with any of the merchants in town.  I can offer much lower prices than they because I do not have the overhead of a shop to maintain.'
