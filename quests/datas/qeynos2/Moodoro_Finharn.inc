Especially Crow's. Although the crowd seems a bit shadier than other places of the sort.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'what testament of vanear'
<br><b>Moodoro Finharn says </b>'So you have heard that good old Moodoro has knowledge of the Testament 

of Vanear. I care little for that book. Of course I have it!! If you want it, I will sell it 

to you for two gold pieces.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'I want page 34'
<br><b>Moodoro Finharn says </b>'So, you know I have page 34. Pretty smart of me to tear the most 

important page out before someone else tried, eh? If you really want it, then sit down and 

deal in. Ante is 4 gold. I will give you one card. If it is a jester, then I will give you 

the page. Let's do it.'

page. Even together, the book is nothing more than fiction.'
