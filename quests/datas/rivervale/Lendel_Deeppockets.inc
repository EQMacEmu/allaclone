<p><b>You say, </b>'what training'
<br><b>Lendel Deeppockets says </b>'There are many steps that a young rouge must take on the road to stealth. The most important part of your training is learning how to use the tools around you such as the forge.

After that, simply tell me what piece of Slickfinger Chainmail you [want] to craft and I will give you a pattern along with a recipe for  [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], [Legplates], [Gauntlets] and [Tunics]. The recipe I will give you for specific items will need to me combined in the assembly kit to create the magical material necessary. Once you have this material and pattern that I gave you when you told me what item you wanted to craft, put both in the nearest forge to create the armor piece you asked for. Here is your Dusty Mail Assembly Kit.'
