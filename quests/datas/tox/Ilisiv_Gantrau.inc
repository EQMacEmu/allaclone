<br><b>Ilisiv Gantrau says </b>'You wield great power. The wind whispers to me. You seek to learn more about the augmentation stones found in ruins long forgotten. They hold great power. A mysterious power. I fear however that if you were to fuse one of these magical stones to your Orb of Mastery, it would be lost due to the transitory nature of the Orb. I believe after much research I have discovered a way for you to make use of these stones if you are [interested].'
<p><b>You say, </b>'interested'
<br><b>Ilisiv Gantrau says </b>'Hand me your Orb of Mastery. I must infuse the power of the elements into a new orb.'
<p><b>You give Ilisiv Gantrau : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28034>Orb of Mastery</a>
<br><font color=green><b>Ilisiv Gantrau </b>begins to chant an incantation. The power within the orb begins to grow. A bright flash nearly knocks you to the ground as the power within the Orb begins to flow around you and Ilisiv. Ilisiv kneels down and etches a triangle in the dirt with her fingers. The triangle begins to glow and the power within the orb erupts in a brilliant display of color and immediately infuses the triangle with its power. Ilisiv makes a final gesture over the triangle and a brief swirl of luminescent light encompasses her. A new orb appears on the ground in the center of the triangle. Ilisiv holds her hand over the triangle and after a moment, all is calm again. The glowing light of the triangle fades.</font>
<br><b>Ilisiv Gantrau says </b>'I do believe this was a success. The power of summoning and elements has been infused into a new orb. Take this new Orb of Mastery. You may now safely use the power of the augmentation stones with your new orb.'
<br><b>Ilisiv Gantrau gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=55273>Ornate Orb of Mastery</a>
<br><b>Ilisiv Gantrau says </b>'I have no need for this item [Your Name]. You can have it back.'
<p><i>This npc will return you any extra items you gave him.</i>
