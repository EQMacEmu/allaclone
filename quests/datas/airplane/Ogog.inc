<p><b>You say, </b>'i do smash test'
<br><b>Ogog says </b>'Ogog smash good. . . Ogog no think you can smash good.  But Ogog let you try.  You get Ogog Djinni War Blade, some virulent wasp poison, and a mottled spiroc feather.  Ogog say you good warrior if you do this!'
<p><b>You say, </b>'i do bash test'
<br><b>Ogog says </b>'This one hard, Ogog like it.  Ogog need efreeti battle axe, some honey nectar, bottled djinni, and ethereal emerald. Then Ogog make you best basher.'
