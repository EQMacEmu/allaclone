<br><b>Bekerak Coldbones says </b>'Well, well, I see Wenglawks finally got around to sending me my new spear. I hope it's not as shoddy as the last one. Your payment? Bahaha, did Wenglawks not tell you? Payment was to be a giant icewurm tooth carved into an amulet. Come now, little one. I will find an ice wurm for us to slay together. 
Then you can pull one of its teeth out for me and I will fashion the talisman for that greedy merchant.'

<br><font color=green><b>Bekerak Coldbones </b>pulls out a large knife and begins to carve at the tooth.
After a few minutes he pulls out a length of rope and fashions it into a very large necklace. 'Here is his payment. Tell him the spear is fine, and that I might reconsider his last offer to me. He will know what I mean.'</font>
