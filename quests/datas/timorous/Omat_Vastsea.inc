<br><font color=green><b>Omat Vastsea </b>bows deeply. 'I have been expecting you, [Your Name]. The waters have foretold your arrival. I am High Priest Omat Vastsea of the Triumvirate missionaries. Please feel free to enjoy the quiet solitude of this inn.'</font>
<p><b>You say, </b>'Triumvirate'
<br><b>Omat Vastsea says </b>'The Triumvirate of Water are: E'ci, the mistress of ice; Tarew Marr, the lord of water; and Povar, the formless master of vapor and mist. We Triumvirate missionaries are granted great divinatory powers and wisdom through our devotion to the Triumvirate and must defend the waters of Norrath from the ravages of the Tyrant of Fire, Fennin Ro.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'Fennin Ro'
<br><b>Omat Vastsea says </b>'The Tyrant of Fire, Fennin Ro, is the merciless lord of fire in all its forms. The rivalry between the tyrant and the Triumvirate is as old as the gods themselves and is an eternal battle. We witness the struggle every moment of our lives as the Oasis of Marr succumbs to the heat of the surrounding desert and is replenished by the swelling of the Lifire River. That fragile balance between the elements must be maintained but the Plasmatic Priesthood threatens that balance.'
<p><b>You say, </b>'plasmatic priesthood'
<br><b>Omat Vastsea says </b>'The Plasmatic Priesthood are worshipers of the Tyrant of Fire, but they have been driven mad by their fanaticism and have forgotten the importance of the balance. In their madness they would set the whole world aflame, leaving nothing but lifeless ash.'
<p><b>You give Omat Vastsea : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28047>Ornate Sea Shell</a>
<br><b>Omat Vastsea says </b>'So, you are a friend of Natasha's? That is good to see. She is a very wise and gifted woman. The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe.'
<br><b>Omat Vastsea gives you : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28051>Coral Statue of Tarew</a>
<p><b>You give Omat Vastsea : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=1299>Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe</a>
<br><b>Omat Vastsea says </b>'You have proven yourself to be one who is willing to take responsibility for his own actions. Such a trait is desired by all deities to be present in their faithful. I pray that you had the wisdom to slay Lord Gimblox as well as the Plasmatic Priest in order to prevent further advancement in the incursion against the Riptides. Priestess Natasha awaits inside the inn for Lord Gimblox's ring, make haste for she is a busy women and will depart soon.'

<p><b>You give Omat Vastsea : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=18170>A Singed Scroll</a>, <a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28017>Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer</a>
<br><b>Omat Vastsea says </b>'I commend you on your success over the fire elemental lord, Ixiblat Fer. The fact that the Plasmatic Priesthood has mustered up the power to summon such a being means drastic actions must be taken to stop the fanatic cult of Fennin Ro. I wonder what kind of favor Zordak Ragefire performed for the sarnak summoners to convince them to assist in the ritual that brought forth Ixiblat Fer. The dragon Iksar hybrid abominations are not beings who ally with others easily. All I have seen in my divinations of the High Plasmatic Priest are riddles, and signs that the one who slays him may be awarded an Orb of the Triumvirate. If you are the one whom my visions foretell, then seek Zordak Ragefire and bring me his heart.'

<p><b>You give Omat Vastsea : </b><a href=http://phobos/eq/item.php?id=28019>Zordak Ragefire's Heart</a>
<br><b>Omat Vastsea says </b>'I see now that Zordak Ragefire and the exiled elder dragon Zordakalicus were the same being. That explains how he resisted our attempts to divine his affairs and past. Each of these orbs I have granted you represents one of the Triumvirate. Jhassad Oceanson awaits on the shore below to perform the ritual that will merge the orbs into a single Orb of the Triumvirate and summon an avatar from the Plane of Water. Present the Orb of the Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water when it arrives and allow your destiny to be unraveled.'
