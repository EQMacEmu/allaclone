<p><b>You say, </b>'what rare tomes'
<br><b>Sornita Eltern says </b>'Why. just yesterday I stumbled upon what I believe to be an excerpt from Miragul's own treatise on the origin of the creatures known as scarecrows.  Such a work is heresy and would be destroyed if the High Council knew of its existence so I have been tight-lipped about my discovery.  If you would like to see it. I will show it to you. for a nominal donation of 20 gold pieces.'
